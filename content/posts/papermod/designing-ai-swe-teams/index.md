### Intro

Welcome to 2024! We are entering a year that will be marked pivotal in the history of software engineering. Human ingenuity and the dramatic rate of innovation within the world of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has taken us further than we could have ever imagined. 

These innovations guarantee to upheave existing software practices and the software engineering profession as we know it.

New, AI-native companies will rise up and threaten existing legacy businesses. The outcome will be profound. Incredible reductions in lead times from idea to shipped product, massive reduction in operational costs and an ever-decreasing need of reliance in human-based software engineering. Yes, I said it. 

Many great firms of our time have large technology teams supporting their business processes like Sales, Marketing, Support and so on. How these teams react will determine not only their survival through these changes, but also contribute to a potentially indomitable competitive edge for the firms they enable.

This paper provides empirical evidence to support the above claims, and shows one possible framework that technology teams can adopt to ride the Shoggoth, and not be eaten by it.
