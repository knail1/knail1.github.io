### Intro

Welcome to 2024! Change is in the air. Do you feel it? 

Human ingenuity within the world of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has taken us further than we could have ever imagined. These innovations guarantee to upheave existing software practices and the software engineering profession as we know it.

New, AI-native companies will rise up and threaten existing legacy businesses. The outcome will be profound. We will witness incredible reductions in lead times from idea to shipped product, massive reduction in operational costs, and therefore radically changed economy and, finally, an ever-decreasing need of reliance in software engineering written by human beings. Yes, I said it. :scream:

Many great firms of our time have large technology teams supporting their business processes like Sales, Marketing, Support and so on. How these teams react will determine not only how they maintain their relevance through these changes, but also contribute to a potentially indomitable competitive edge for the firms they enable.

This paper provides empirical evidence to support the above claims, and shows a possible framework that technology teams can adopt to ride the [Shoggoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoggoth).
