# Backdrop
I still remember how it started. I was in Austin on a Saturday, enjoying the Data Day Conference, one of my annual self-indulgences, when I got a call from an SVP I knew. Odd. While he and I had a great relationship, we hadn’t worked for a while; I knew something was up. After some niceties, he told me I was a major topic of conversation on the CIO’s Friday call. The context was that a complex multi-million data migration project was deep red, and the CIO wanted to revamp the leadership to get it back on track. The SVP, knowing I had a deep passion for data, had floated my name as a candidate to take over the data space and drive this project and the org, and all his peer SVPs concurred. It just so happened that I was between jobs within the company, so the timing appeared perfect. Another few SVP calls and an ‘inspiring’ CIO call later on Monday I found myself as the Head of Data Platform and Data Engineering group for the company!
