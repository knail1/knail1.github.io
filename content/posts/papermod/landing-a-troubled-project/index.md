## Backdrop
I still remember how it started. I was in Austin on a Saturday, enjoying the Data Day Conference, one of my annual self-indulgences, when I got a call from an SVP I knew. Odd. While he and I had a great relationship, we hadn't worked for a while; I knew something was up. After some niceties, he told me I was a major topic of conversation on the CIO's Friday call. The context was that a complex multi-million data migration project was deep red, and the CIO wanted to revamp the leadership to get it back on track. The SVP, knowing I had a deep passion for data, had floated my name as a candidate to take over the data space and drive this project and the org, and all his peer SVPs concurred. It just so happened that I was between jobs within the company, so the timing appeared perfect. Another few SVP calls and an 'inspiring' CIO call later on Monday I found myself as the Head of Data Platform and Data Engineering group for the company!

## The Framework: Two's a Company
The CIO leadership team had thought it through. Along with the need for a total revamp for the product line, they also noticed material weakness in the technical program management. So they also assigned a senior Technical Program Manager, Sam Wingo, to partner with me. This was a brilliant call. Along with ensuring the technical aspects of the project were on sound footing, the program also desperately needed structure and clarity on measurable progress.
For big budget programs, a two-in-a-box technical and program leadership is essential. The reality is that there's typically a wide palette of players involved in these complex initiatives - internal delivery teams, external delivery partners, internal customers, executive leaders, infosec and technical operations teams, and so on. Interacting with all of them effectively requires a tag team with complementary skills.
The optimal team dynamic here is a partnership of equals with no egos. Chemistry matters, though competent senior leaders are typically able to figure out how to work effectively with any personality type, so this usually isn't a major roadblock. What's crucial is that both leaders maintain strong opinions, lightly held. They must vigorously debate approaches, sometimes taking opposing sides just to test assumptions. In troubled projects where the clock is ticking, time is not on your side. You cannot afford to make wrong moves because there's no slack left in the timeline for course-correction. This is why stress testing solutions and approaches to problems prior to putting them in play is essential.
This dual leadership approach excels at expanding the possibilities. These projects typically need to flex and pivot, perhaps multiple times. Assessing the situation, discussing options, and adapting becomes crucial. Having opinions from two seasoned leaders helps stretch the universe of possibilities and ensures the most optimal path is selected.
Perhaps most importantly, you're not alone. Having a partner who is equally committed to winning gives you a feeling of strength. There's never a moment where you feel isolated - your partner is just a phone call away to talk through anything at all.
Given the late stage this project was in, it needed exactly this combination. While a two-in-a-box approach at project inception might easily pair a product leader with an engineering leader, this troubled project required the TPM/Tech combo to provide the structural rigor that had been missing.

#### Setting up the partnership

This was a team of equals with no egos. Chemistry mattered, though competent senior leaders are typically able to figure out how to work effectively with any personality type, so this usually isn't a major roadblock.
We both knew there wasn't much time and every hour counted. For that purpose, we were always talking or texting adhoc, discussing issues as they came up. We would spend time preparing for major meetings, or discuss approaches to talk to certain stakeholder personalities, or sometimes just to vent to each other!
Most importantly, we both colored outside our lines. In times of war, there are no rigid roles and responsibilities - just taking the right call fast. For instance, I was totally cool if he had to talk or direct anyone in my org about a deliverable. He felt the same way if I was setting up and orchestrating weekly all-hands calls with all the stakeholders. The project came first, not our individual domains.

#### Your partner
Since I was the engineering leader responsible for the project, I will talk about my Program Management partner. This should help you identify the skills and personality traits required in a TPM for a major project going sideways. 
Sam brought something our troubled project desperately needed: the Winston Wolf mentality.
His approach was fundamentally different from traditional program management. Where others might get paralyzed by the complexity, Sam would calmly assess the facts: What's the real timeline? What are the actual blockers versus perceived ones? Who has authority and who doesn't? He had this ability to cut through the noise and identify what really mattered in a matter of hours, not days or weeks. One thing I learnt from him is, just pick up the phone and talk to the person.
What made him effective in this crisis was his work ethic and calm under pressure. I remember collaborating with him at three in the morning during that final push. He had this ability to stay focused and rally the team around a clear goal, maintaining that singular belief in winning even when things looked impossible.
Sam was the perfect complement to my technical leadership because he brought the structural rigor that our project had been missing. While I focused on the engineering challenges, he ensured we had a plan that people actually followed - and the authority to make them follow it.

## Mindset

#### “We will succeed”

Perhaps the most important ingredient for both of us was the mindset that no matter what, we were going to succeed. We completely believed in it. This does not mean we acted fool hardy and expected the laws of physics to bend to our will. Later in this writeup, you will see that we had a highly data driven approach towards running this project. 

What this means is that there in our bones we did not internalize that “we will try our best”.  There were no marks here for effort. There was a hard financial penalty facing the company if we did not hit the date. This was all about finishing the job. While both of us didn’t ever explicitly talk about this mindset, we could sense that both of us held it.

By focusing on “success”, you are choosing how to feel. You feel optimistic, positive, energized.

Conversely if you focus on “not failing” you are essentially leaving the door open to allow the feelings of  pessimism and negativity to come in. 

There were moments deep into the project that things were going off the rails. That was the time we just had to create a “positive” echo chamber amongst ourselves and will the project forward. If you stop believing you will be successful, your team will stop believing this. As a leader, you’re the source of the river of positivity which feeds all the fields downstream.

Sometimes, there were folks in the team pushing back that things could not happen. The approach we went in on every one of these types of conversations was not “No, and this is why, but Yes, and this is how”. 

You have to keep asking what else. You have to know this space deeply to come up with creative ideas. And typically there is always a way, a path forward. It may approximate the result instead of hitting bulls eye. Sometimes it may require taking on technical debt. But in my mind when time is not on your side, all these shortcuts are allowed. You just make a note of them in your backlog, communicate clearly with leadership your tradeoff decisions and how you will address them later on, and then come back to it in future releases.

#### Being vs Doing

Most leaders focus obsessively on doing - the external, visible activities that fill our calendars and define our professional identity. But what I discovered during this project was that the quality of your actions is fundamentally connected to what you're being in any given moment.
Take a simple example: if you're being "tired," the same task becomes sloppy and ineffective. But if you're being "refreshed and alert," that identical task gets executed with precision and insight. This matters exponentially in stressful circumstances where there's no room for error.
During our troubled project, I learned that I needed to be intentional about being curious rather than defensive, being positive rather than reactive, being expansive rather than constrained. When I operated from these states of being, I found that the actions I executed had a degree of quality, intensity, and efficacy that would otherwise not be there.
In the heat of a crisis project, taking regular breaks from doing mode feels counterintuitive. But whether through planned short breaks, meditation, or prayer, these moments of intentional being weren't a luxury - they were what enabled the doing to be effective at all. By temporarily stepping away from the duties and dramas that bombard us, what's in the background becomes foreground, and what's waiting in the wings gets an entrance cue.
